# cvpage
A small page loaded with personal information. I want to show my programming skills based on themselves. This web is created using the Materialize framework for the front-end part and for the back-end NodeJs and MongoDB are used for the storage and management of the projects. The idea is to leave reflected the use of these technologies.  Comments and improvements are accepted.
